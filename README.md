# Lab1
<p> Create a GitHub repository for the project. </p>
<p>Create a few issues (3 Issues per student) and assign those issues to each other.</p>
<p>For your project, you should enable GitHub pages and make a very simple one-page website about your project. (Don't bother wasting time on the layout and styles of the web page)</p>
<p>Add your first commit to your project by creating a new file (If done in pairs: each team member will make commits such as creating a file and writing some random code)</p>
<p>Now that commit has been created, share your proposed change through a pull request. "pull requests help you share your changes, receive feedback on them, and iterate on them until they’re perfect!"</p>
<p>View and respond to the pull request made by each one of you. Merge those pull requests into the Master branch.</p> 
<p>Implement software delivery of your project work by using a release-based workflow in GitHub</p>
<p>Create a beta release for the repository of your project on GitHub. Use a specific stage version by specifying a number such as 1.0.1. Mark this as a pre-release since it represents a beta version. </p>
<p>Prepare a project board to manage your next release. (Assume certain features of improvements or bug fixes that will go into the next release)</p>
<p>Create some cards for your project board. The cards can be existing issues or pull requests or some text.</p>
<p>Start preparing for a future release. Create a long-lived branch as release-v1.1. </p>
<p>Apply some changes such as adding a new feature or just making commits to your existing codebase. </p>
<p>Add this new commit (new feature) on the release branch.</p>
<p>Merge the pull request to update the release branch.</p>
<p>Create a pull request to bring the new feature into the main. </p>
<p>Approve changes for the next release.</p>
<p>Use the Release Drafter GitHub app to help with release notes.</p>
<p>Merge the configuration file for Release Drafter to set a template for the release.</p>
<p>Merge the release branch into the main and finalize the release.</p>
