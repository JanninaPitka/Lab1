# Lab1
Create a GitHub repository for the project. 
Create a few issues (3 Issues per student) and assign those issues to each other.
For your project, you should enable GitHub pages and make a very simple one-page website about your project. (Don't bother wasting time on the layout and styles of the web page)
Add your first commit to your project by creating a new file (If done in pairs: each team member will make commits such as creating a file and writing some random code)
Now that commit has been created, share your proposed change through a pull request. "pull requests help you share your changes, receive feedback on them, and iterate on them until theyâ€™re perfect!"
View and respond to the pull request made by each one of you. Merge those pull requests into the Master branch. 
Implement software delivery of your project work by using a release-based workflow in GitHub
Create a beta release for the repository of your project on GitHub. Use a specific stage version by specifying a number such as 1.0.1. Mark this as a pre-release since it represents a beta version. 
Prepare a project board to manage your next release. (Assume certain features of improvements or bug fixes that will go into the next release)
Create some cards for your project board. The cards can be existing issues or pull requests or some text.
Start preparing for a future release. Create a long-lived branch as release-v1.1. 
Apply some changes such as adding a new feature or just making commits to your existing codebase. 
Add this new commit (new feature) on the release branch.
Merge the pull request to update the release branch.
Create a pull request to bring the new feature into the main.
Approve changes for the next release.
Use the Release Drafter GitHub app to help with release notes.
Merge the configuration file for Release Drafter to set a template for the release.
Merge the release branch into the main and finalize the release.
